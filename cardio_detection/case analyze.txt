Case Analysis: Cardiovascular Disease Dataset

Data Description

The dataset consists of 1000 rows and 13 columns.
There are no null values in the dataset.
No duplicates are found in the dataset.
Statistical Description

Patient ages range from 20 to 80 years, with an average age of around 49 years.
The majority of patients are male (76.5% male, 23.5% female).
There are several numeric columns such as resting blood pressure (restingBP), serum cholesterol, maximum heart rate (maxheartrate), etc.
The target variable "target" is a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.
Variable Correlations

The correlation table and heatmap show some correlations between variables.
Correlations can provide insights into the relationships between variables; for example, maximum heart rate (maxheartrate) has a negative correlation with age.
Data Visualization

Pairplot is used to visualize the distribution and correlation between variables, with different colors for the target category.
The histogram of patient age shows the distribution of patient ages in the dataset.
Gender Analysis

The countplot graph shows that the majority of patients are male.
Within the gender group, the number of cases of cardiovascular disease (target) is compared for males and females.
Machine Learning Modeling

The RandomForestClassifier model is used to predict cardiovascular disease.
The dataset is split into training data (70%) and test data (30%).
The model achieves an accuracy of around 98.33% on the test data.
The confusion matrix shows that the model performs well in predicting the "absence" and "presence" classes of cardiovascular disease.
Model Storage

The RandomForestClassifier model is saved using joblib with the name "RFC_cardio.joblib".
Conclusion:

The dataset is quite clean and does not have missing or duplicate values.
The machine learning model (Random Forest) provides good results in predicting the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.
In the gender analysis, it is observed that the number of males in the dataset is higher, and cases of cardiovascular disease are more frequent in males.
Recommendations:

Further analysis can be conducted to understand potential risk factors that may influence cardiovascular disease.
Further modeling or parameter optimization can be done to improve model performance.
Delving deeper into the relationships between variables and considering new features may provide additional insights.
